## About
Software architect and systems engineer with more than 12 years of experience designing and maintaining high-scale platforms, distributed systems and long-lived software environments.

I focus on clarity, predictable behavior, and architectural stability over time. My work emphasizes maintainability, correct data modeling and the reduction of operational complexity.

## Work & Experience
- Led technical strategy and implementation for platforms serving audiences in the order of millions.
- Architected distributed pipelines for media processing, metadata extraction, analytics layers and automated reporting.
- Built internal frameworks and front-end architectures to enforce consistency and scalability across multiple products.
- Developed analytical, attribution and performance optimization systems for large-scale marketing and behavioral data environments.
- Designed and maintained execution environments for algorithmic research and backtesting workflows.
- Implemented observability layers, structured logging, error taxonomies and reliability programs for long-running services.

I specialize in stabilizing, scaling and extending complex systems without compromising clarity.

## Advanced Competencies
- Mathematical modeling for systems behavior, complexity boundaries and scaling curves.

## Advertising, Attribution & Growth Systems

I have managed large-scale, high-budget advertising ecosystems (multi-million USD annual spend) where operational precision and signal integrity directly influence revenue. My approach focuses on automation, verifiable attribution, adaptive optimization and minimizing performance entropy across pipelines.

**Paid Media Strategy & Optimization**
- Campaign planning and execution across: Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Microsoft Ads, Taboola, Outbrain, private DSPs
- Advanced optimization of CPA, CPM, CPC, ROAS and LTV using:
  - Conversion window analysis and bid adjustment heuristics
  - Real-time signal scoring and dynamic budget reallocation
  - Behavioral segmentation, cohort-based targeting and safe scaling strategies

**Automated Campaign & Creative Systems**
- Automated generation of ad variations (text, layouts, targeting configurations)
- Continuous experimentation engines using bandit algorithms (Thompson Sampling, UCB1)
- Creative iteration pipelines with AI-assisted copy, visual adaptation and multilingual rollout
- Programmatic execution of campaign life cycles (creation → testing → scaling → retirement)

**Attribution & Measurement**
- Deterministic and probabilistic attribution frameworks: UTM + contextual fingerprinting + MTA blends
- Integration with Google Analytics Data API, BigQuery, Microsoft Clarity, Appsflyer and SKAdNetwork
- Resolution of cross-device and cross-region discrepancies
- Signal clarity enforcement through noise modeling, fraud suppression and invalid traffic isolation

**Compliance, Policy & Rights**
- Rights and licensing management, distribution agreements and DMCA/DRM constraints
- GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and data minimization compliance
- Implementation and governance of CMPs supporting IAB TCF v2.2
- Policy-safe creative and audience structuring across regulated verticals

**Data Engineering for Growth**
- Audience clustering using RFM, behavioral windows, semantic similarity and lifetime value projections
- Predictive scoring for churn, conversion likelihood and spend elasticity
- Feature store design for real-time optimization models
- Operational and analytical dashboards using ClickHouse, BigQuery, Redshift, Grafana and Metabase

**Operational Excellence**
- Budget entropy monitoring for waste reduction and anomaly detection
- Intelligent alerting for creative fatigue, segment drift and funnel instability
- Campaign-level decision trees and attribution path audits

## Current Focus
- High-reliability distributed computation environments.
- Attribute and schema modeling for systems expected to live for years.
- Formalizing reasoning around correctness and operational confidence.
- Performance refinement across compute, I/O and front-end rendering.
- Systemic simplification and reduction of operational entropy.
- Integrating semantic search, chained models and structured reasoning flows.

## Approach
I build systems that:
- Remain understandable years later.
- Fail gracefully and predictably.
- Scale without architectural drift.
- Serve real, sustained purposes instead of trends.

I build to endure.
